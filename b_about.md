### Superclark is clark's tech site

I come from wordpress, while i found jekyll is more flexiable, and even more interesting. So i come here. This website is main to record my learning path of software engineering.
The theme used is based on [Freshman theme](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman/).Best thanks to the author.
